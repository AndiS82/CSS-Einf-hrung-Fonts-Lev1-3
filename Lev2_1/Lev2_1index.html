        <p>Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty Thor. I never loved you. No, just a
            regular mistake. Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew.
        </p>
        <p>Oh no! The professor will hit me! But if Zoidberg 'fixes' it… then perhaps gifts! With gusto. Yes. You gave
            me a
            dollar and some candy. You guys aren't Santa! You're not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus?

        <p>You guys go on without me! I'm going to go… look for more stuff to steal! Who am I making this out to? Why
            would
            a robot need to drink? You'll have all the Slurm you can drink when you're partying with Slurms McKenzie!

        <p>For the last time, I don't like lilacs! Your 'first' wife was the one who liked lilacs! Check it out, y'all.
            Everyone who was invited is here. Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets?</p>
